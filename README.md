What does the app do?

It gives the user movie recommendations on categories of:
  1. Popular movies
  2. Top Rated  
  3. Upcoming
  4. Now Playing
  
  Upon selection a list of movies is displayed and on selecting a movie, its plot, poster, release date and title are displayed.
  
  Note: These lists are maintained by The Movie DB : https://www.themoviedb.org/
  
Why did I make it?

  To learn about App development using custom lists, JSON data parsing using GSON and Retrofit libraries. To display images using Picasso library.
